Project Title: How Video Games Can Elicit Emotions From The Player.

Supervisor: Martin Read

Project Vision:

This project will explore how people can be emotionally impacted by video games.

Who Is The Project For?

The project will be for video game developers, and those who want an emotional experience.

What Problem Is The Project Solving?

It is hard to make your video games an emotionally enriching experience, this project will be a teaching tool for developers who want to make those who play their games feel strong emotions. 

The Name Of The Project

The report will be titled “How Can Video Games Be Used To Elicit Strong Emotions From The Player?” and the video game will be called “An Experiment Of Emotion”.

What Is The Project?

There will be two different parts of this project, the first will be a video game which will be split into different segments each dedicated to a different emotion. When going through a section the player will hopefully feel that emotion. The second part of the project will be a report on the game, detailing how each segment elicits its specific emotion. This report will also include an overview of what has been learnt when studying how video games can emotionally impact their players, playing the game and reading the report should hopefully help video game developers in the future when it comes to creating more emotionally enriching video games, games that are more than just fun.

How will the game play though? How a character feels can elicit different emotions so the game needs a basic gameplay type that can be manipulated to fit the different emotional areas without the gameplay feeling too disjointed, of course the game will feel slightly disjointed just because of it’s more of an interactive demonstration on how to make the player feel things than a normal game. The game needs to keep the gameplay somewhat consistent to minimalize the feeling of a disjointed piece, and to minimise the need for many tutorials, if the gameplay shifted in every area then the game would have to teach the player the areas unique controls. 

The game will be first-person, you’ll be able to move, run, jump, and use your run to boost your jump, not a creative moveset but one that can be slightly manipulated to make the player feel different strong emotions, there will be gates the player goes through that increase and decrease their movement speed and jump height, with a universal gameplay mechanic the player should feel like they’re playing through a singular game that makes them feel numerous different emotions, not a number of games that just happen to share the same name. Controlling the players movement speed and jump height is essential to making them feel different emotions, to make them feel happy you’d want them to be able to move fast and jump high, to make them feel sad you’re going to want them to walk slowly and barely be able to jump, to make them feel helpless you’d give them a large area and a fast run speed, or a small area and a slow running speed. This simple moveset and the addition of gates that alter it slightly will allow the player to feel different emotions in different areas of the game.

By limiting the game to simple gameplay it will make the project more viable to create, make the game less disjointed, and stop the player from getting confused. 

The game will be level-based with every level meant to make the player feel a different emotion, the levels will be displayed one after another with small breathing rooms in between to try and get the player to a more neutral emotion before they experience something else. The game will move between a positive and a negative emotion in each level so the player doesn’t get overwhelmed, the levels will be short unless a longer level is needed to properly give the desired emotion. The short length of the levels will allow for the creation of numerous different levels in the short development time this game will have. 

When developing the game one level will be fully developed before moving onto another, after a batch of about three levels are made, they will be tested and altered appropriately. Once those levels are complete and properly elicit the correct emotions then development on the next batch of levels will begin if there is enough time. The amount of levels that are in the game will depend on how quickly the levels are made but will most likely be between three and nine with an estimation of around six.

The game will need a lot of play testing to make sure the emotions players feel from the levels are felt by a large amount of people that go through them, due to the pandemic testing people in person will be practically impossible so the project will rely on using online communication and surveys.

What Are The Key Reasons To Use The Product?

The experience that the product will provide is unique, a way for developers to learn how to make their games more emotionally enriching. By making the product a video game itself, it will be a more entertaining way of learning the techniques needed to make players feel heavy emotions when playing a video game.
